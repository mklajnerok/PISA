    "## Intro\n",
    "Public schools were already known in antiquity and many societies developed them for years to finally end up with mandatory public institutions in the XIX century. Communities all over the world took care of educating youger generations providing a better future, because education has many benefits not only to individuals involved, but to society at large as well. Competition around countries is also not a new concept and education is only one of many factors taken into consideration while making a cross-national comparisons. Even though, it seems that nowadays people compete for jobs not just locally but internationally more than ever before and education is one of the most important instruments to gain an advantage. There is probably a number of factors that should be taken into account wondering what helps  students be prepared for further study, careers and life. One of the question we may ask is can we tell that there is a relationship between nation's wealth or its spending on education and students' performance? Let's try to answer this question using some open data sets, Python language and regression analysis. "

    "## What is PISA?\n",
    "First thing you need to ask yourself is how to measure performance, meaning how to tell that one country is doing better than the other in general? The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<a herf=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD\">OECD</a>) is putting a lot of resources to design a proper measure for this comparison. From year 2000 they are performing a complex study every three years.\n",
    "The Programme for International Student Assessment (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment\">PISA</a>) evaluates the extent to which 15-year-old students, near the end of their compulsory education, have acquired key knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. The assessment focuses on the core school subjects of science, reading and mathematics. The assessment does not just ascertain whether students can reproduce knowledge; it also examines how well students can extrapolate from what they have learned and can apply that knowledge in unfamiliar settings, both in and outside of school. This approach reflects the fact that modern economies reward individuals not for what they know, but for what they can do with what they know. The findings from PISA allow policy makers around the world to gauge the knowledge and skills of students in their own countries in comparison with those in other countries, set policy targets against measurable goals achieved by other education systems, and learn from policies and practices applied elsewhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most interesting findings from the latest 2015 report are that:\n",
    "- Singapore outperforms all other participating countries/economies in science. Japan, Estonia, Finland and Canada are the four highest-performing OECD countries.\n",
    "- Nearly 20% of students in OECD countries, on average, do not attain the baseline level of proficiency in reading. This proportion has remained stable since 2009 [<a href=\"#source_1\">1</a>, p.3-4]."

    "\n",
    "Regression analysis should be able to produce an equation that will predict dependent variable (average PISA result) using one or more independent variables (GDP per capita). Using just one independent variable seems insufficient to explain all the variability in dependent variable, but we can still try to understand how it could affect the outcome on its own. When running your regression, you are trying to discover whether the coefficients on your independent variables are really different from 0 (so the independent variables are having a genuine effect on your dependent variable) or if alternatively any apparent differences from 0 are just due to random chance. The null (default) hypothesis is always that each independent variable is having absolutely no effect (has a coefficient of 0) and you are looking for a reason to reject this theory [<a href=\"#source_6\">6</a>].\n",

    "Now our data form something resembling straight line, but still there is one dot which seems to be an outlier from the linear model - it’s Luxembourg. It's a country that has been considered second richest in the world for many years lately. Luxembourg is a place with relative high income per capita and according to Business Insider report this is due to the large number of people working in the tiny nation while living in surrounding France, Germany and Belgium (it can be even one quarter of the entire population, who are not included in GDP calculation [<a href=\"#source_7\">7</a>]). Excluding Luxembourg from regression might seem like a good idea, that's why we will perform the analysis in two versions to compare the results."

Starting with kindergarten we can add up expenses per student according to another assumption, that every pupil spent 3 years in pre-primary institutions, 6 years in primary and then 3 more in lower- secondary. This way, we are going to calculate total cost of each student education before being evaluated.

    "As we see NaN values started to occur and using .isnull() method we can check that there's more of them in the whole data frame. There are a few ways to deal with those lacks, but in this case it seems reasonable to make a use of Python build in function called <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.interpolate.html#pandas.DataFrame.interpolate\"> interpolate</a>. In order not to fill the gaps, where we don't have enough information let's make an assumption. For every country in the dataset first check the number of NaN in a given period we are interested in, for example years 2003-2005 for pre-primary education. If any lack occurs, examine the whole column for a given level of education. If the ratio of NaN is below 50% we will interpolate for the whole column, in other cases we will drop the country. "

There is also another specific thing about this plot, it seems like we have a group of countries centralised around the point with 500 PISA points and 11,5 expenses, while the others, with less spending form a line. It raises a question, is it possible that after reaching some point of expenses per student we do not see to much difference in the assessment score? "

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapping all the conclusions, we can say that there is a moderate positive relationship between PISA performance and country GDP per capita. This is not only a mattaer of potential, because analyzing real expenses on education gave us the same conclusion. Even though richer countries and those that allocate more resources in education score better, it's still impossible to state the direction of the relation. It may be that the wealth of the country is the reason for high score or it's the situation, where an effective education system produce smart people, who pursue to increasing their country income. The sample analyzed in the text was also not big enough to draw strong conclusions about the relation. The education effectivness itself could be maseured differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis leaves us with more questions than answers, that is one of the reasons I decided to make a second part of it. There are probably numbers of factors worth analysing in context of PISA performance. We could try some unsupervised learning using clustering methods to identify other relations, which may not seem so obvious. We could check correlation strength of many of them and choose only the most relevant. Then we could try fitting polynomial of different degrees and cross-validate them to check the prediction power of tested models. I hope you enjoyed my work and I'm looking forward to describing the results soon!"
